# Cryptography
This is a Java Project Containing Various Cryptography Methods:

- RSA Cryptography
- ElGamal Cryptography
- Paillier Cryptography

Each of these Cryptography methods encrypt and decrypt messages and 
calculates certain values that are required for these processes. Each
Cryptography calculator briefly explains the steps that are undertaken
to compute the final correct results.

These Cryptography calculators can be used for any projects such
encrypting and decrypting messages for personal use or for Educational
purposes. These calculators will help you easily calculate certain values
or parameters instead of manually going through the whole calculation
process.

#Version
Version 1.0.0.0

Note: There may be calculation error for certain values entered as
they are not possible to be calculated.

There may be more additional Cryptography methods added to this in
the future and also it may be improved with 100% bug fixes.

#Developer
The project is developed by Ehsan Khalid under my company name
EK Creations.
